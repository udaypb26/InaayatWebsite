Thank you for downloading my fonts! Everything I have is freeware, so feel free to use it, and/or share with everyone you know!
Please don't try and claim my fonts as your own, and if you post them on a website, it'd be nice if you asked first. But as long as you put a link to my website along with it and/or include this read me file, I'm cool.

Comments can be sent to shoshanna33@yahoo.com and my website is http://users.cwnet.com/shoshana/serendipity.html

Enjoy!
