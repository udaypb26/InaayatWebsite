					<br>
					<p style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, serif;">One day suddenly in the college canteen, our eyes fall upon that beautiful girl. We would've seen a 100 girls in the campus yet it is nothing compared to her. Head over heels we fall. From trying to talk to her to becoming friends. The love progresses word by word, conversation by conversation, day by day. From meeting between classes it goes to bunking classes to meet her. She is all that you need. She becomes your passion and emotion. Her sideways glance, gives you butterflies. <br>

                    Friends? Best friends? It rings in one's head. There is an irresistible urge to convey your love. Take the relationship forward, make the relationship just more than Friends. This is when proposal comes into play.  </p>

					<br>
					<img class="img-responsive" src="img/post-3 images/icon-img.jpe" alt=""><br>
					<br>
					
					<p style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, serif;"> Proposal. The next big plan. How are you going to execute your dream proposal? Pulse racing, nervous, shivering, awkward moments. You really don't have to worry that much because if she really loves you she would say yes no matter what. But Do not take 'the proposal' for granted for she might be impressed by the proposal.</p>
					
					
					<br>
					<blockquote>"The best love is the kind that awakens the soul; that makes us reach for more, that plants the fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. Thatâ€™s what I hope to give you forever." </blockquote>

					<p>So here are some tips on executing your dream proposal and getting the girl of your dreams : </p>
					<br>
					<h2><span style="font-family:blog-header;text-size:200%;color:red">1) Tell her you like a girl : </span></h2>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, serif;">As absurd as the idea may sound, trust me on this one, it works. You go tell your girl that you like a girl. If there's is bit of disappointment in her face well then you've already succeeded. But wait that's not it. Tell her how much you 'love' that girl. This way it gives you a method to tell how much you love her. She'll be impressed you love a girl so much. When she becomes curious to know who that 'girl' is, you start off by giving clues and cutting down all possibilities until it reduces to only her. Well she should get it that you're talking about her and if she doesn't, (change the girl.Just kidding don't !) <br>Tell her that the girl you love is no one else but her. I'm sure she'll be flattered and impressed. </p>
					
					
					<br>
					<br>
					<h2><span style="font-family:blog-header;text-size:150%;color:red">2) A poem with flowers : </span></h2>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Here we use the good old fashioned way. Write a poem for her! Easier said than done but yes she's gonna love it. Put in all those feelings and emotions. It's going to be easy doing it with her in your heart. It's going to be effortless. Go ahead and write one and make sure you don't copy from Google because that's totally not cool. It has to be your emotions. It need not be the best poem ever. It's enough if it's your poem. Give it to her along with some flowers and chocolates and let's hope for the best. </p>
					
					<br>
					
					<br>
					<h2><span style="font-family:blog-header;text-size:150%;color:red">3) The beach plan :   </span></h2>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, serif;"> Take her to the beach. (if you live in a costal city that is) The evening time, dusky and beautiful. By the sea. What could be a better setting to ask the girl of your dreams out? If you can incorporate the poem with flowers idea with this setting it'd be great.   </p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<h2><span style="font-family:blog-header;text-size:150%;color:red">4) Balloons and gift :   </span></h2>
					<p style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Basically you'd need a bunch of kids and some balloons to execute this idea. Attach notes and gifts to the balloons, make sure you mention your name and hers (just in case). You can even put a ring inside the balloon and ask the kids to give it to her. She's going to appreciate the fact you put in effort and thought into it. She'll love it. </p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<h2><span style="font-family:blog-header;text-size:150%;color:red">5) FLASH MOB : </span></h2>
					<p style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Last but not least, take her by surprise. This is one of the most innovative and impressive ideas one could come up with. So what is a flash mob? You could be in the middle of the park or at the beach or in a mall. It is a dance which is shown to be done as impromptu in any public place, the dancers are disguised as normal people and all of a sudden music plays and they start dancing attracting attention. Much like Bollywood style. <br>Arrange for a flash mob to take her by surprise and express your love for her. She will be left speechless. In case you are wondering how to arrange for a flash mob, do not worry as Inyaat arranges for it. Just hit us up and we'll do it for you. </p>
					
                 <h3 style="color:teal">Go ahead and impress some one now!</h3>
